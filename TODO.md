FIXME
-----

* iOS 15:
  - specifying the destructive actions in .confirmationDialog() causes the preceeding alert not to be displayed when NFC is not supported by a device
  - *"NFC scan success sheet displayed when NFC scan time out"* (https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/687264)
* Xcode 13:
  - *"No 'async' operations occur within 'await' expression"* warnings
* @Published classes nonsense
* Libre 3:
  - Catalyst doesn't detect it
